slay the spire style roguelite but with dice building

when you get new dice, you know how many faces it has, but not what each face does
rolling a die will reveal the face it lands on permanently
faces can have good and bad effects

you can get a new die after each battle

basic effects
  damage a monster
  damage multiple monsters
  add armor
  increase stats
  heal health

  lose armor
  lose health
  buff monsters


game features
  Menu
  Game
    battle scene
      ability to roll dice
      and to get new dice
    store scene
      ability to buy/sell dice
    map scene
      ability to choose between branches


first build basic battle system
  has a one or many monsters
  has a player
  both have hp, armor and damage
  monsters and player take turns
  monsters show intention via icons and move after player
  player can deal damage or raise armor on their turn
  player can damage monsters and vice versa
  player wins when monsters die
  player loses when they run out of health
  art:
    player (attack, damaged, defend, die)
    monster (attack, damaged, defend, die)
    background
    ui for dice rolling


then add map
  generate a simple tree of different node types
    battle
    store
    event
    boss
  should start with 3 options and end with a single boss option
  should display map
  allow player to select next path
  art:
    background
    4 node types
    path
    player

then add dicebuilding
  first need a fun system for selecting and rolling dice
  need to figure out how dice availability works, probably similar to quarriors
  need a system for implementing different shaped dice
  need a system for identifying die faces when rolled
  need a menu for adding new dice
  need a menu for removing dice
  need a menu for upgrading dice
  art:
    different dice shapes
    die face icons + numbers

player starts game and moves through map, completing battles and adding/removing/upgrading their dice, until they run out of hp or defeat the boss

basic die could be
  2 shield+1 faces
  1 shield+2 face
  2 damage1 faces
  1 damage2 face

  upgraded version could double all values

different face types
  damage single enemy
  armor
  draw 1 die
  re-roll die
  heal?
  damage multiple enemies in specific pattern?
  increase str/dex?
  stun?
  poison/bleed?
  status - junk die like in slay the spire
  powers like in slay the spire?
  curses like in slay the spire?


start with POC:
  add text to dice menu
  basic intention system for enemies
  add basic boss monster

  examining dice to see faces
  add more event node types than just remove

  add energy system for using dice?
  add identification system
