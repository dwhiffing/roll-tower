slay the spire style roguelite but with dice building

when you get new dice, you know how many faces it has, but not what each face does
rolling a die will reveal the face it lands on permanently
faces can have good and bad effects

different die shapes
  d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20

you can get a new die after each battle

basic effects
  damage a monster
  damage multiple monsters
  add armor
  increase stats
  heal health

bad effects
  lose armor
  lose health
  buff monsters


game features
  Menu
  Game
    battle scene
      ability to roll dice
      and to get new dice
    store scene
      ability to buy/sell dice
    map scene
      ability to choose between branches


first build basic battle system
  has a one or many monsters
  has a player
  both have hp, armor and damage
  monsters and player take turns
  monsters show intention via icons and move after player
  player can deal damage or raise armor on their turn
  player can damage monsters and vice versa
  player wins when monsters die
  player loses when they run out of health
  art:
    player (attack, damaged, defend, die)
    monster (attack, damaged, defend, die)
    background
    ui for dice rolling


then add map
  generate a simple tree of different node types
    battle
    store
    event
    boss
  should start with 3 options and end with a single boss option
  should display map
  allow player to select next path
  art:
    background
    4 node types
    path
    player

then add dicebuilding
  first need a fun system for selecting and rolling dice
  need to figure out how dice availability works, probably similar to quarriors
  need a system for implementing different shaped dice
  need a system for identifying die faces when rolled
  need a menu for adding new dice
  need a menu for removing dice
  need a menu for upgrading dice
  art:
    different dice shapes
    die face icons + numbers

player starts game and moves through map, completing battles and adding/removing/upgrading their dice, until they run out of hp or defeat the boss


start with POC:
  only one type of die(d6) with basic graphics
    attack faces and armor faces
  system for drawing and rolling dice, and targeting monsters or yourself with them
  examining dice to see faces
  system for adding/removing/upgrading dice
  add support for selecting specific dice and targeting a monster
  support for up to 5 monsters
  add basic boss monster
  add identification system

  DONE:
    linear map that only has 2 battles and the boss
    battle system only has one monster type, one monster
    monsters can only attack to do 1 damage
    ability to win the game
    ability to lose the game
    dice art
    icons for dice (sword=attack, shield=armor)
    ui for hp bars
    player sprite
    monster sprite
